<h1>Welcome to Vimarsh's Programming Portfolio</h1>
        <p> My name is Vimarsh Rana. This website is my portfolio of all the programs that I will write this semester for the CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island. I wrote the web page by using the HTML language and CSS coding. The Apps link will have all of my apps that I will make this semester. The About Me link will have all the information on me. Finally, the Javascripts link will have Javascripts that I have written and created.</p>
